# 3plug Journal

## Purpose

Use this folder for state logging so we can track what we are doing, what changed, and what comes next.

## Journal Path

- `doc/journal/`

## Journaling Rule

- Journal every meaningful planning decision, architecture change, implementation step, and workflow update.
- Keep entries short but specific enough to reconstruct what happened and why.
- If a change is intentionally kept out of commits (ignored docs, local experiments), record it here.

## What to Log

- Current focus / task
- Changes made
- Decisions taken
- Blockers / open questions
- Next steps
- Screenshots (SS) or references related to the session

## Suggested Naming

- Daily log: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Screenshot files: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-01.png`
- Notes with screenshots: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`
