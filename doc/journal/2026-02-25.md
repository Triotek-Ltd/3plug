## Focus
Define the planning baseline and future direction for 3plug, then establish a delivery path and complete the architecture/model doc set, plus branding/SEO foundations and a docs index before development rollout work.

## Current State
- `doc/current_state.md` was reviewed and polished into a confirmed baseline.
- `doc/target_state.md` and `doc/future_state.md` were created to define platform direction.
- `doc/delivery_path.md` was created to define the build/run path from dashboards to cloud-native production.
- Core architecture/model docs were drafted locally (ignored from commits):
  - `doc/platform_bundle_spec.md`
  - `doc/app_bundle_spec.md`
  - `doc/tenant_provisioning_flow.md`
  - `doc/marketplace_flow.md`
  - `doc/cloud_runtime_topology.md`
  - `doc/platform_api_contracts.md`
  - `doc/entitlement_model.md`
  - `doc/bundle_compatibility_policy.md`
- Branding and SEO foundation guides were added before Phase 2:
  - `doc/branding_guide_3plug.md`
  - `doc/seo_guide_3plug.md`
- `doc/how_to_use_docs.md` and `doc/docs_index.md` were added to guide doc usage and navigation when development work starts.

## Changes Made
- Created `doc/journal/` and `doc/journal/README.md`.
- Added docs for current/target/future state and delivery path (local planning docs under `doc/`).
- Added platform/app bundle specs, tenant provisioning flow, marketplace flow, cloud topology, API contracts, entitlement model, and compatibility policy drafts.
- Added `doc/how_to_use_docs.md` (read order, doc purpose, update rules, journaling workflow for development).
- Added `doc/docs_index.md` (navigation map for planning/architecture/branding/SEO/journal docs and read order).
- Added `doc/branding_guide_3plug.md` (color system, gradients, typography, effects, logo usage, UI application rules) based on current 3plug logo and Triotek parent brand palette.
- Added `doc/seo_guide_3plug.md` (SEO positioning, page IA, metadata patterns, technical SEO, marketplace SEO, pre-launch checklist).
- Reviewed current branding assets in `public/brand/logo-3plug.png` and `branding&seo/triotek/branding/`.
- Updated `.gitignore` to ignore `doc/**` except `doc/journal/**`.
- Untracked non-journal docs from git index (`doc/rnd/rnd.md`, `doc/rnd/rnd2.md`).

## Decisions
- Portal is always the main interface (cloud-native and local/on-prem).
- Platform bundle and app bundles must be separate.
- App bundles include core plugs (`OPS`, `MGT`, `ADM`) and industry packs (`SP1`-`SP8`).
- Cloud-native is primary; local/on-prem remains supported.
- 3plug future positioning = platform runtime + publisher ecosystem + full marketplace.
- Delivery path from dashboards to cloud run must be explicitly documented.
- App bundles will use a manifest-based spec with versioning, compatibility, lifecycle, and entitlement metadata.
- Tenant provisioning flow must be based on the platform account model and branch by account type (Business vs Publisher/Contributor).
- Marketplace flow is part of the architecture/model-first work and should be defined before deeper structure implementation (Phase 2 path work).
- Cloud topology should separate control plane and tenant runtime conceptually, while allowing phased runtime isolation (shared first, selective isolation later).
- Dev work should follow an explicit docs usage flow and journal discipline to keep planning and implementation aligned.
- Platform/API, entitlement, and compatibility contracts/policies are part of the architecture-first set and should be defined before Phase 2 structure work.
- Branding and SEO foundations should be documented before rollout-oriented build work so UI structure and public pages are consistent from the start.
- A docs index should exist before Phase 2 so the team can navigate the planning set quickly.

## Blockers
- None blocking documentation progress.
- Remaining refinements include final API payload details, artifact packaging/distribution, async orchestration model, and branding asset production (simplified marks/variants) before public rollout.

## Next Steps
- Begin Phase 2 structure work from `doc/delivery_path.md` (dashboard/platform structure path), using the architecture, branding, and SEO guides as constraints.
- Continue journaling each planning/architecture decision and implementation step.
